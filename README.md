## 📋 Project Overview
This project extends our previous **FireLite-Seg** segmentation work (96.85% accuracy, 11.6 FPS on Jetson Nano) to include **human and animal detection** for complete UAV-based search and rescue operations.

### 🔬 Previous Work Included
- FireLite-Seg: Lightweight fire segmentation model
- Corsican Fire Dataset processing
- Jetson Nano deployment pipeline
- Evaluation metrics (IoU: 96.32%, Dice: 97.45%)

### 🎯 New Objectives
1. **Multi-class Detection**: Fire + Human + Animal
2. **Real-time Performance**: Target 15-25 FPS on Jetson Nano
3. **Search & Rescue Integration**: Alert system for emergency response
