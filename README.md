## 📋 Project Overview
This project extends our previous **FireLite-Seg** segmentation work (96.85% accuracy, 11.6 FPS on Jetson Nano) to include **Fire,Human and Animal detection** for complete UAV-based search and rescue operations.

### 🔬 Previous Work Included
- FireLite-Seg: Lightweight fire segmentation model
- Corsican Fire Dataset processing
- Jetson Nano deployment pipeline
- Evaluation metrics (IoU: 96.32%, Dice: 97.45%)

### 🎯 New Objectives
1. **Detection models**: Fire + Human + Animal
2. **Real-time Performance**: Target 15-25 FPS on Jetson Nano
3. **Search & Rescue Integration**: Alert system for emergency response

Every sub-project Segmentation, Detection and Deployment have their on Readme files and contain full information to use those projects for future works.
